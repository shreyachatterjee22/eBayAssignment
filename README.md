# eBayAssignment

Welcome to my new repo! My ebay_dl.py file will scrape eBay for any search term you input and return an organized JSON file of the results. The main steps are <ol><li>generate the url</li><li>download the first ten pages</li><li>create dictionaries for certain charecteristics of the listing</li>
  
 #Here is how you would run the file: 
 ###You can add custom page numbers but the default is 10 and I will use that
  
        python3 ebay.dl 'search_term' 
  
I used the words 'random books', 'night', and my own name 'shreya' as my example terms. The commands look like this
 
        python3 ebay.dl 'random books' 
        python3 ebay.dl 'night' 
        python3 ebay.dl 'shreya'
